# EVI

EVI is a UCF-based student calendar event tracker. It allows students to follow events from the UCF School Website or other student-created events from their RSOs (registered student organizations).

## Students

Students can follow events from their daily calendar. It displays 'Public,' 'Private,' and 'RSO' events. Public events are visible to all accounts, private events are shown to all students from the same school, and individual RSO events appear to students who have joined that particular RSO. Students can request to create new RSOs with four other students, and the creator becomes an Admin.  

## Admin

Admins are students that are the head of an RSO. They can create RSO events for other students in their RSO or create private events for their university. 

## Super Admin

The super admin is a unique user that controls all of their universities. They can edit their university profiles and request to regulate new universities. They also approve the creation of a new RSO and, in the process, create new Admin accounts.
